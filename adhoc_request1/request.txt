e.	Add two tabs—one for cancer and another for non-cancer—in each file—one for incident patients with complete, 
    364-day follow-up and the second for incident patients with fewer than 364 days of follow-up—listing 
    the number of patients in each group—SEL30, SEM30, ME, and CU—that had an injury within 14 days 
    prior to or on the day of the start of their OxyContin episode.  Define an injury as any patient 
    with an ICD-9 diagnosis code in the following injury groups, according to the CDC 
    (see the attached CDC primary and secondary ICD-9 groupings):  800-904, or 920-929, or 950-959.  
    For Multiple Episode Users, include them in the counts if they had an injury before their first episode.
i.	Do the same for surgery instead of injury—however you define surgery.
ii.	Do the same for ‘injury or surgery’—that is, whether the patient had either an injury or 
    a surgery within 14 days of the start of his or her episode.
iii.	Do the same for acute pain, where acute pain is defined as the patient having
      an ICD-9 code that your team associated in the “ICD Validation_Draft.xlsx” file with 
      (1) an “ACUTE or CHRONIC (if indicated)” column value of blank (i.e., not “Chronic”) and 
      (2) a GROUP value that is not blank.
iv.	Do the same for chronic pain, where chronic pain is defined as the patient having 
    an ICD-9 code that your team associated in the “ICD Validation_Draft.xlsx” file 
    with an “ACUTE or CHRONIC (if indicated)” column value of “Chronic.”  
v.	Do the same for each of the 19 CDC primary ICD-9 code groupings in the attached.  
    That is, for each patient group and CDC primary code grouping, have a row indicating 
    the number of patients in that patient group that had an ICD-9 diagnosis code 
    in that CDC primary code grouping.  Patients with a diagnosis in more than one primary 
    code grouping will be counted in more than one row.
